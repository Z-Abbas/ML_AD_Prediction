# ML_AD_Prediction
Alzheimer's disease prediction based on autoencoder and multi-omics data integration

We developed an approach for predicting one of the most common neurological disorders, Alzheimer's disease, using gene expression (GEO ID: GSE33000 and GSE44770) and DNA methylation (GEO ID: GSE80970) datasets.
